# activeBarriers
**activeBarriers** computes material active barriers to the transport of momentum and vorticity for flows defined on a three-dimensional cartesian grid

This repository is the reference implementation of the active barriers for a turbulent channel described in 

``` G. Haller et al., "Objective material barriers to the transport of momentum and vorticity", submitted to Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 2020 ```

### Description

The computation is divided in two steps, each of them provided as a separate program:
1) *barrierField.cpl*: the computation of the three-dimensional active barrier field from velocity data
2) *ftle.cpl*: computation of aFTLE/aPRA diagnostic for the active barrier field
